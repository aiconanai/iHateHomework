### What is it 
iHateHomework is only a part of iHateSchool plan. When go through the whole 4 years in university,
I find so many useless homework wasting so much time in which I could learn my awesome tech or cool things.

So iHateHomework comes! Homework is real a shit, just ignore them and spent more time to learn what you want!
